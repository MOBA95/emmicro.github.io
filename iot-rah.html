								<p>With increase in population we have an increase in the garbage around urban areas. Here we propose a smart dustbin that operates automatically to help solve this issue using IOT and sensor based circuitry. Usual dustbins require to be opened by pressing foot against its lever and then throwing garbage. Also a person needs to keep track when it is full so that it can be emptied and does not overflow. Here we propose a smart dustbin that does all this by itself. Our system consists of a sensor in order to detect human clap signal and on a clap of foot tap it opens automatically without anyone needing to press its lever. The dustbin opens automatically when it receives the signal and closes its hatch. Also the dustbin consists of a level sensing ultrasonic sensor that constantly measures the level of garbage in the bin and automatically detects if it is about to fill up. The dustbin now consists of a smart circuitry that transmits this information over the web to signal the main garbage collector of the facility to empty the particular garbage bin. We use IOT to develop the online web part for the IOT system. This bin is of a vast usage in offices, homes and even in public places for garbage management.  Thus we get a fully automated smart dustbin that allows for automated garbage cleaning.</p><a></a>
								Nature is a very important asset today. It is a basic source of various aspects to us. There are various types of destruction and pollution that has been done today. Pollution is not focused on illegal logging, animal hunting and so on. But waste disposal everywhere is also a pollution of nature. When people throw garbage everywhere, it will cause our air to be contaminated indirectly damaging the level of cleanliness around. Actually, this happens because of the lazy attitude of the community to throw away the rubbish in the proper place or the provided waste bin is full. Consequently, using the most sophisticated technology now, we have built a project that will enable the people around us. Using the concept of Internet Of Thing, we have developed Smart Dustbin that can help many people and solve various problems.

								<p>Smart dustbin is a very good project that can be a solution to the problem. This smart dustbin worked when a person step to nearest smart dustbin, it will detect the motion of the feet by using the motion sensor. Then when the person want to throw the rubbish into the dustbin, the just need to clap one time or make the other sound using theirs body and the trash can cover will be open on its own. Once the trash been thrown away, and within 5 seconds no further disposal is made, the trash cover will close by itself. It’s totally different as usual dustbins require to be opened by pressing foot against its lever and then throwing garbage. Not only that, when the usual dustbin is full and overflow, the person who incharged will not noticed about it easily. But by using the smart dustbin, the dustbin consists of a level sensing ultrasonic sensor that constantly measures the level of garbage in the bin and automatically detects if it is about to fill up. The dustbin now consists of a smart circuitry that transmits this information over the web to signal the main garbage collector of the facility to empty the particular garbage bin. So, the person who incharged this cleaning service no need to worry again about the overlow of the trash and they just need to check it once a day to make sure it is in good condition or not. There’s some device that have the similiarity with us but what make us better than them is the ultrasonic sensor application. They just had the auto open and close the cover up of the dustbin but when the trash being overflow it still produce the problem. Therefore, the products we have created have a better innovative power than their products. Furthermore, using this IOT concept, we can apply our products to the better. This product can facilitate various types of industries, especially in the field of cleaning services. we hope this product will be one of the most commonly used products everywhere to facilitate the global community and indirectly protect the environment better. </p>
